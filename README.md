# Max-Msp-LightFixture
A LightFixture external object to help make sending DMX messages really easy.

Build
---------
To build this you need to download the Max/MSP/Jitter SDK at https://cycling74.com/downloads/sdk/.
The version I'm using right now is 6.1.4.
After you have downloaded the SDK, just copy this repo into a lightfixture folder within the examples folder.
Your file structure should be MaxSDK-6.1.4/examples/max/lightfixture/'this repos files'.
Then using command line run 'cd MaxSDK-6.1.4/examples' then run 'ruby build.rb'.

This works for me on OS X 10.10 hopefully it will work for you.
